## Introduction 

The dataset utilised in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book, 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow', is presented here. The reason why this serves as a great introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms is because it involves basic data cleaning, provides a clear list of variables that are easy to understand, and is of an ideal size that is neither too simplistic nor too complex.
